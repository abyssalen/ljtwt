Wrote this project for a school course. It was required that all .java files be converted to .txt files for some reason and so this program was written to automate the proccess.

What this program does is first shows a GUI asking for the input directory which is the directory with the java sources. The program will then walk through the directories, trying to find any java sources and then it will convert them into .txt files with proper formatting for Windows. The program will output these .txt files into the output directory which the user specifies.

Since Linux was used to write code for school assignments, the formatting of text files from Linux would not look good on Windows. This program deals with this problem.
